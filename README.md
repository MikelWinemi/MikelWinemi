# Hello, World! 👋

I'm Mikel Winemi Ayariga, an android developer with a passion for creating innovative and efficient applications. I specialize in using **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, **Flutter**, and **Python** to build user-friendly and high-performance apps.

## 🛠 Skills and Tools

- **Kotlin**: I use Kotlin to write clean, concise, and efficient code for Android applications. It's my go-to language for Android development.

- **Jetpack Compose**: I utilize Jetpack Compose to build intuitive and dynamic UIs for Android. It allows me to create flexible designs with less code and in less time.

- **Flutter**: I also have experience with Flutter, which lets me build natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. It's a great tool for cross-platform development.

- **Python**: I use Python for a variety of tasks, including data analysis, machine learning, and scripting. It's a versatile language that complements my Android development skills.

## 📚 Continuous Learning

I believe in continuous learning and improvement. I'm always exploring new technologies and tools to stay updated and enhance my skills.
